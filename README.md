# MIT-EEE

Here are all the "Electrical Engineering and Computer Science" courses that MIT has to offer:

[MIT EECS Courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Electrical%20Engineering%20and%20Computer%20Science&s=department_course_numbers.sort_coursenum&type=course&u=compact)

From the list above, I have removed courses that are not relevant to Electrical Engineering (EE) because they are:

- Purely related to Electronics Communication Engineering.
- Entirely focused on Computer Science.
- Highly specific courses (like "Introduction to Convex Optimization").
